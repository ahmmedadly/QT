# Car Dashboard Infotainment System

This project is a **Car Dashboard Infotainment System** developed using the **Qt6 Framework**. It simulates a car dashboard with interactive features such as headlight control, turn signals, and a horn sound. The project also integrates the **Caps Lock LED** to reflect the headlight state, demonstrating hardware-software interaction.

## Features
- **Headlight Control**: Toggle the car's headlights on and off.
- **Turn Signals**: Control left and right turn signals with interactive icons.
- **Horn Sound**: Play a realistic horn sound with the click of a button.
- **Caps Lock LED Integration**: Simulate the Caps Lock LED to reflect the headlight state.
